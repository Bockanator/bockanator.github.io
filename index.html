<h1>Info</h1>
<p>Hi this is my website for the game Catch of the Day.
It is recommended you click on the tutorial in game <br>
before playing. There are some
intricacies that
 are not taught in the short tutorial
that you are intended to<br>  learn playing the game.    
Sound will not work for the main menu until you have
clicked onto the game once it has loaded.</p>

<p>Programming & development was done by Luca (me),<br>
Art & Music was done by my friends Aryan and Jarrah.</p>
